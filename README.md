More than 70% of the population of Bangladesh lives in rural areas where access to formal financial services is difficult. Yet these are the people who are in most need of such services, either for receiving funds from loved ones in distant locations or to access financial tools to improve their economic condition. Less than 15% of Bangladeshis are connected to the formal banking system whereas over 68% have mobile phones. These phones are not merely devices for talking but can be used for more useful and sophisticated processing tasks. bKash was conceived primarily to utilize these mobile devices and the omnipresent telecom networks to extend financial services in a secure manner to the under-served remote population of Bangladesh. bKash can be accessed via all the mobile networks operating in Bangladesh. Currently, bKash is running a network of more than 180,000 agents throughout urban and rural areas of Bangladesh with over 30 million registered accounts.
